# PRISM Examples Monorepo

## Overview

Welcome to the PRISM Examples Monorepo! This repository contains a collection of example PRISM interactions, designed to speed up the integration of PRISM AI agents and machine learning (ML) models within decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Each example demonstrates how to interact PRISM AI agents and ML models into Solana-based applications, providing users with robust tools to navigate and interact with the DeFi ecosystem.

PRISM is a B2B Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that enables businesses to harness the power of AI for their decentralized applications. It allows developers to create customized AI agents by linking them to trained ML models, such as the Egeria token risk model. These agents can be deployed via API, providing seamless integration into existing workflows.

## Codebase Structure

The monorepo follows the following format: `interaction/language`. This codebase will grow overtime to support more languages and integration examples.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and navigate to the example and language applicable to your team.
