# PRISM Agent Chat - NextJS

This is a [PRISM](https://prism.sh/) hello-world example by [Trustless Engineering](https://trustless.engineering/), showcasing how quickly and easily you can integrate a PRISM agent into your project. This project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and the UI is built with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

You can check out [the PRISM GitHub repository](https://github.com/prism-sh) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!
